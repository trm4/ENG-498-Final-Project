# ENG-498-Final-Project
In this project I wanted to go out and see if there was any relationship between a company's stock price and tweets about that company. In ths project I have a dataset that includes tweets for the past 5 years on 5 separate companies (Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Tesla). I analyzed the tweet quantity versus volume traded for that company. I also looked at the tweets's sentiments versus stock price.
